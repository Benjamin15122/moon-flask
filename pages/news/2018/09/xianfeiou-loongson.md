# A team won First Prize (Second Place) in 2018 Loogson Cup Computer System Contest

The team built an out-of-order MIPS32 processor (on FPGA) running a self-built modern operating system and applications (window manager, terminal emulator, full system emulators, etc.). One of our PhD students, Xianfei Ou from the [SPAR group](/spar/), leads the system and application software developments. 

The software architecture design was led by [Dr. Yanyan Jiang](http://moon.nju.edu.cn/~jyy), who is now teaching "Operating Systems" and "Introduction to Computer Systems" (Practicum Part). The series of designs (including hardware part design by [Zihao Yu](https://sashimi-yzh.github.io)) will be incorporated in the undergraduate curriculum at Nanjing University.
