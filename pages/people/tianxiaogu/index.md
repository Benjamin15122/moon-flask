!!!note:
    A project may not be publicly available if we are working on a paper about it.


* [Javelus](http://bitbucket.org/javelus/)
    * A dynamic-updating-enabled JVM built on top the HotSpot JVM in OpenJDK 8
* [MiniTracing](http://bitbucket.org/javelus/javelus):
    * A whole program tracing tool that can trace method entrance/exit, object allocation, GC moving events in the JVM.
    * Checkout the branch `mini-tracing` of `javelus`
    * Other tools based on this project:
        * [PHD](https://bitbucket.org/txgu/phd): Precise Heap Differentiating: An experimental tool aiming at precisely differentiating two heap snapshots.
* [Ares](http://bitbucket.org/txgu/ares)
    * An automatic-runtime-recovery-enabled JVM
* [AOTES](https://bitbucket.org/txgu/aotes-asm)
    * Automating object transformations for dynamic software updating via execution synthesis
