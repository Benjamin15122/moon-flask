# Engineering Seamless Evolution and Environment Perception for Self-adaptive Software Systems


Software systems working in open environments such as the Internet and Cyber-Physical Systems are always facing changes in their underlying environment and in user requirements. Many of these systems have to automatically adapt themselves to these changes at runtime. This research is aimed at facilitating the engineering of self-adaptive software systems. Expected outcomes include (1) a general and flexible architecture for self-adaptive software systems, which supports proactive adaptations in addition to reactive ones, (2) an approach to seamless software evolution, i.e., updating a part of a software system at runtime in a timely and low-disruptive way and without any compromise in system consistency, and (3) a disciplined method for software environment perception, which leverages environmental models a priori to recognize systems’ dynamic contextual situation in an accurate and efficient way. Tools enabling the application of these techniques will also be developed. As our long-term goal is a next-generation middleware system with comprehensive support for self-adaptation, techniques’ applicability to the mainstream software development will be emphasized in the research.
