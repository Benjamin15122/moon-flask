@article{Li_CyanDroid_SCIS16,
	Abstract = {Smartphones are an indispensable part of people's daily lives. Smartphone apps often use phone sensors to probe their users' physical environmental conditions to provide services. However, sensing operations can be energy-consumptive, and thus the obtained sensory data should be effectively utilized by apps for their users' benefits. Existing studies disclosed that many real-world smartphone apps have poor utilization of sensory data, and this causes serious energy waste. To diagnose such energy bugs, a recent technique GreenDroid automatically generates sensory data, tracks their propagation and analyzes their utilization in an app. However, we observe that GreenDroid's sensory data generation is random and this can negatively affect its stability and effectiveness. Our study reported that GreenDroid might miss energy bugs that require specific sensory data to manifest. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to systematically generating multi-dimensional sensory data. For effective diagnosis, we also propose to consider app state changes at a finer granularity. We implemented our approach as a prototype tool CyanDroid, and evaluated it using four real-world Android apps and hundreds of their mutants. Our results confirmed that CyanDroid is more stable and effective in energy inefficiency diagnosis for sensory data underutilization issues.},

@article{Zhang_spreadsheet_2017,
	Abstract = {Abstract While spreadsheets are widely used, they have been found to be error-prone. Various techniques have been proposed to detect anomalies in spreadsheets, with varying scopes and effectiveness. Nevertheless, there is no empirical study comparing these techniques' practical usefulness and effectiveness. In this work, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of three state-of-the-art techniques on their effectiveness in detecting spreadsheet anomalies. Our study focused on the precision, recall rate, efficiency and scope. We found that one technique outperforms the other two in precision and recall rate of spreadsheet anomaly detection. Efficiency of the three techniques is acceptable for most spreadsheets, but they may not be scalable to large spreadsheets with complex formulas. Besides, they have different scopes for detecting different spreadsheet anomalies, thus complementing to each other. We also discussed limitations of these three techniques. Based on our findings, we give suggestions for future spreadsheet research. },

To enable effective and efficient shared memory dependence tracing, we present an optimistic scheme addressing the challenge of capturing exact dependences between unsynchronized events to reduce the probe effect of program instrumentation. Specifically, our approach achieved a wait-free fast path for thread-local reads on x86-TSO relaxed memory systems, and simultaneously achieved precise tracing of exact read-after-write, write-after-write and write-after-read dependences on the fly. We implemented an open-source RWTrace tool, and evaluation results show that our approach not only achieves efficient shared memory dependence tracing, but also scales well on a multi-core computer system.},

	Abstract = {Context-aware applications adapt their behavior based on contexts. Contexts can, however, be incorrect. A popular means to build dependable applications is to augment them with a set of constraints to govern the consistency of context values. These constraints are evaluated upon context changes to detect inconsistencies so that they can be timely handled. However, we observe that many context inconsistencies are unstable. They vanish by themselves and do not require handling. Such inconsistencies are detected due to misaligned sensor sampling or improper inconsistency detection scheduling. We call them unstable context inconsistencies (or STINs). STINs should be avoided to prevent unnecessary inconsistency handling and unstable behavioral adaptation to applications. In this article, we study STINs systematically, from examples to theoretical analysis, and present algorithms to suppress their detection. Our key insight is that only certain patterns of context changes can make a consistency constraint subject to the detection of STINs. We derive such patterns and proactively use them to suppress the detection of STINs. We implemented our idea and applied it to real-world applications. Experimental results confirmed its effectiveness in suppressing the detection of numerous STINs with negligible overhead, while preserving the detection of stable context inconsistencies that require inconsistency handling.},

@article{JavelusIST14,
	Abstract = {Context
In-use software systems are destined to change in order to fix bugs or add new features. Shutting down a running system before updating it is a normal practice, but the service unavailability can be annoying and sometimes unacceptable. Dynamic software updating (DSU) migrates a running software system to a new version without stopping it. State-of-the-art Java DSU systems are unsatisfactory as they may cause a non-negligible system pause during updating.

Objective
In this paper we present Javelus, a Java HotSpot VM-based Java DSU system with very short pausing time.

Method
Instead of updating everything at once when the running application is suspended, Javelus only updates the changed code during the suspension, and migrates stale objects on-demand after the application is resumed. With a careful design this lazy approach neither sacrifices the update flexibility nor introduces unnecessary object validity checks or access indirections.

Results
Evaluation experiments show that Javelus can reduce the updating pausing time by one to two orders of magnitude without introducing observable overheads before and after the dynamic updating.

Conclusion
Our experience with Javelus indicates that low-disruptive and type-safe dynamic updating of Java applications can be practically achieved with a lazy updating approach.},

	Abstract = {Formal specification and runtime detection of contextual properties is one of the primary approaches to enabling context awareness in pervasive computing environments. Due to the intrinsic dynamism of the pervasive computing environment, dynamic properties, which delineate concerns of context-aware applications on the temporal evolution of the environment state, are of great importance. However, detection of dynamic properties is challenging, mainly due to the intrinsic asynchrony among computing entities in the pervasive computing environment. Moreover, the detection must be conducted at runtime in pervasive computing scenarios, which makes existing schemes do not work. To address these challenges, we propose the property detection for asynchronous context (PDAC) framework, which consists of three essential parts: 1) Logical time is employed to model the temporal evolution of environment state as a lattice. The active surface of the lattice is introduced as the key notion to model the runtime evolution of the environment state; 2) Specification of dynamic properties is viewed as a formal language defined over the trace of environment state evolution; and 3) The SurfMaint algorithm is proposed to achieve runtime maintenance of the active surface of the lattice, which further enables runtime detection of dynamic properties. A case study is conducted to demonstrate how the PDAC framework enables context awareness in asynchronous pervasive computing scenarios. The SurfMaint algorithm is implemented and evaluated over MIPA--the open-source context-aware middleware we developed. Performance measurements show the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of SurfMaint, even when faced with dynamic changes in the asynchronous pervasive computing environment.},
