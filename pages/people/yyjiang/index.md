* I am working on the *Project-N* in which students build a complete computer system (NPC SoC, NEMU system emulator, Nanos operating system, NCC compiler, and applications) from scratch.
* I am the inventor of Nanos, a teaching OS and taught the practicum part of *Operating System* course at Nanjing University from 2010 to 2014.
* Selected talks
    * 计算：万物的起源和终点 [![](/static/img/icon-pdf.png)](teach/20140121.pdf) (Keynote speech at 2014 JSOI Winter Camp at Mudu high school).
    * 从逻辑门到电子计算机 [![](/static/img/icon-pdf.png)](teach/20141008.pdf) (Guest lecture for 2014 Introduction to Computer System at NJU).

## Services

* Reviewer: Frontier of Computer Science.
* Program Committee member of Jiangsu Olympiad in Informatics (the official programming contest hoster for high school students) since 2015 after serving 9 years as volunteer problem setter, coach, and judge.

## Honors and Awards
* 2016 Distinguished Student of Nanjing University (the only PhD student out of ten winners).
* 2014 MSRA Fellowship Award; 2015 and 2010 National Scholarship;
* First Place in the 2014 Huawei Cup Regional Programming Contest; second Place in the 2012 Tencent Hackathon.
