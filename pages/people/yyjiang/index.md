## Research

I'm a coder striving to make programming less miserable. I'm interested in technologies that can *automatically* make computer software better: testing, analysis, and synthesis. ([知乎专栏 ![](img/zhihu.png)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/se-research/) and chronological list of [my publications](pub).)

* Understanding Shared Memory Dependences
    * CARE [[ICSE14](pubs/care)], RWTrace [[ASE15](pubs/rwtrace)], BC [[FSE16](pubs/bc)], Survey [[JoS17](pubs/survey)], and my [PhD Thesis](pubs/thesis).
* Software Testing and Analysis
    * Mobile Apps
        * *Platform* (ATT [[Internetware15](pubs/att)], CoseDroid [[COMPSAC15](pubs/cosedroid)]); *Event Generation* (GAT [[APSEC16](pubs/gat)], AATT [[APSEC16](pubs/aatt), [SCP18](pubs/aattplus)]); *Leveraging Human Insights* (UGA [[APSEC14](pubs/uga)]); *Analysis* (RepDroid [[ICPC17](pubs/repdroid)]);
    * Reliability
        * *Crash Consistency* (C3 [[FSE16](pubs/c3)]);
    * Symbolic Analysis
        * *Fault Localization* (Comedy [[COMPSAC15](pubs/comedy)]);
* Program Synthesis
    * *Transformers* (AOTES [[ICSE17 Poster](pubs/aotes)]);
* Software Technologies
    * *Software Building* (ABC [[APSEC15](pubs/abc)]); *Runtime Verification* (GAIN [[APSEC14](pubs/gain), [IST16](pubs/gain1)]).

## Teaching

* I am working on the *Project-N* ![](img/logo-n.png) in which students build a complete computer system (NPC SoC, NEMU system emulator, Nanos operating system, NCC compiler, and applications) from scratch. I am the inventor of *Nanos* and *AbstractMachine* in Project-N, and contributed to the overall system-stack design.
    * We got Second Place in the 2017 Loongson Cup computer system design contest.
* Selected talks:
    * “计算：万物的起源和终点” [![](/static/img/icon-pdf.png)](teach/20140121.pdf) (Keynote speech at 2014 JSOI Winter Camp at Mudu high school).
    * “从逻辑门到电子计算机” [![](/static/img/icon-pdf.png)](teach/20141008.pdf) (Guest lecture for 2014 Introduction to Computer System at NJU).

## Services

* ![](img/noi.png) Scientific Program Committee member of Jiangsu Olympiad in Informatics (the official programming contest hoster for high school students).
* ![](img/acmicpc.png) Coach of the programming contest training team at Nanjing University.

## Honors and Awards
* 2016 *Distinguished Student* of Nanjing University (the only PhD student out of ten winners).
* 2014 *MSRA Fellowship Award*; 2015 and 2010 *National Scholarship*;
* First Place in the 2014 Huawei Cup Regional Programming Contest; Second Place in the 2012 Tencent Hackathon.
* During my collegiate years, I competed in *ACM-ICPC* regional contests for two Gold Medals and earned 49th place in the 2009 World Finals.
