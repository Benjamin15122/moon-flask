## Research

I'm a coder striving to make programming less miserable. I'm interested in technologies that can *automatically* make computer software better: testing, analysis, and synthesis.

* Understanding shared memory dependences:
    * CARE [[ICSE14]()], RWTrace [[ASE15]()], BC [[FSE16]()], Survey [[JoS17]()], and my [PhD Thesis]().
* Software testing and analysis
    * mobile apps
        * platform: ATT [[Internetware15]()], CoseDroid [[COMPSAC15]()]
        * event generation: GAT [[APSEC16]()], AATT [[APSEC16](), [SCP18]()];
        * mobile meets human insights: UGA [[APSEC14]()];
        * analysis: RepDroid [[ICPC17]()];
    * reliability
        * crash consistency: C3 [[FSE16]()];
    * symbolic analysis
        * fault localization: Comedy [[COMPSAC15]()];
* Software technologies
    * building technologies: ABC [[APSEC15]()];
    * runtime verification: GAIN [[APSEC14](), [IST16]()].

All publications are listed chronologically [here](pub).

## Students

招生：欢迎有意愿从事软件工程/程序分析研究的同学！

## Teaching

* I am working on the *Project-N* in which students build a complete computer system (NPC SoC, NEMU system emulator, Nanos operating system, NCC compiler, and applications) from scratch. I am the inventor of Nanos (Nano-OS and Nan-OS) in the Project-N.
* Selected talks
    * 计算：万物的起源和终点 [![](/static/img/icon-pdf.png)](teach/20140121.pdf) (Keynote speech at 2014 JSOI Winter Camp at Mudu high school).
    * 从逻辑门到电子计算机 [![](/static/img/icon-pdf.png)](teach/20141008.pdf) (Guest lecture for 2014 Introduction to Computer System at NJU).

## Services

* Scientific Program Committee member of Jiangsu Olympiad in Informatics (the official programming contest hoster for high school students).

## Honors and Awards
* 2016 Distinguished Student of Nanjing University (the only PhD student out of ten winners).
* 2014 MSRA Fellowship Award; 2015 and 2010 National Scholarship;
* First Place in the 2014 Huawei Cup Regional Programming Contest; second Place in the 2012 Tencent Hackathon.
* During my collegiate years, I competed in ACM-ICPC regional contests for two Gold Medals and earned 49th place in the 2009 World Finals.
