<P>
<I>TopcoderChallenger</I> (we use <I>TCC</I> for short) is a cheating
program designed for challenge phase of algorithm <I>Topcoder</I>
contests.

<P>
<I>TCC</I> works as follows: user firstly specify contest meta-data
such as class names, entry method names, entry method signatures and
several test cases. Then each time one opens up a challenge window,
he/she could use the heap dump functionality provided by VisualVM
to obtain the coder's actual code. At any time, a mini "system test"
could be performed to run each program against every test case. The
system test results will be displayed for your reference. Below is
a screenshot taken from codes crawled from SRM597 practice room with
two manual test cases.

<P>
In this demo, we tested all example test cases and two extra manual
corner test cases which is easily for coders to ignore. The system
test result finds several wrong submissions in the practice room.
It also surprisingly finds one coder's submission even cannot pass
all the examples. All submissions marked red are being successfully
challenged.

<p>
For Linux users, if your VisualVM GUI freezes, it is due to a bug (feature) of Swing implementation in OpenJDK. This can be fixed by replacing with Oracle's JRE.
