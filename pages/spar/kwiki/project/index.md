# Paper tools
1. Using [LyX](http://lyx.org) can greatly ease struggling with LaTeX.
2. We have prepared a [template](lyx/acm-lyx.zip), and this template itself is the document [writing ACM sig-alternate papers with LyX](lyx/acm-lyx.pdf).


# Project management

Everyone in the group would use Git to manage code, papers and personal homepage.

1. [Pro Git - Everything you need to know about the Git distribute source control tool](http://www.git-scm.com/book/zh "Pro Git").
2. [Contributing to the SPAR homepage (Linux/Cygwin)](git/GitLabManualForLinux.pdf "Gitlab Manual for Linux").
3. [Contributing to the SPAR homepage (Windows)](git/GitLabManualForWindows.pdf "Gitlab Manual for Windows"). Please note that these steps are **not sufficient** to access our GitLab. Refer to the Cygwin version for more details.

# HotSpot VM based tools

1. [Javelus - A dynamic-updating-enabled JVM](http://git.artemisprojects.org/public).
1. [Java+ - A failure-oblivious JVM](https://bitbucket.org/txgu/failure-oblivious-jvm).
