# Paper Writing Guidelines

1. Papers should be prepared in a two-phase process, namely, framework phase and content phase.
2. Framework phase:
    1. Prepare the paper title and all section titles (including sub-section ones). All section
       titles should follow a similar pattern.
    2. Prepare the abstract and all topic sentences for paragraphs in each section (including
       sub-sections). Each paragraph has only one topic sentence. Connected topic sentences
       should cover all logics and contents in the paper.
    3. List all concepts (terminologies only) for each responsible section/subsection that plans
       to define them. List them immediately after section/subsection titles with brackets. The
       order the concepts are listed should follow their dependencies. No concept can be listed
       more than once.
    4. Send the framework for discussions and approval.
3. Content phase:
    1. Prepare the contents for each paragraph. The contents should not be beyond the scope of
       a paragraphâ€™s topic sentence. The topic sentence should still be in the paragraph
       explicitly marked in red. The topic sentence must not be revised, or can be revised a
       little after obtaining the approval.
    2. The contents in each paragraph can only use concepts defined earlier. The places where
       concepts are defined must not change, or can after obtaining the approval.
    3. All figure and table captions should follow a similar pattern.
4. Other points:
    1. Acknowledgment and corresponding author information is not necessary for initial
       submissions.
    2. Co-authors must not be added or adjusted without obtaining the approval.
    3. Submit papers only when obtaining the approval. Change the topic sentence color and
       remove listed concepts before the submission.
