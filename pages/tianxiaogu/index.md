## Projects

* [Javelus](http://lab.artemisprojects.org/javelus/javelus)
    * A dynamic-updating-enabled JVM
* [Ares](http://lab.artemisprojects.org/groups/ares)
    * An automatic-runtime-recovery-enabled JVM
* [AOTES](http://lab.artemisprojects.org/javelus/aotes)
    * Automating object transformations for dynamic software updating via execution synthesis
* [MiniTracing](http://lab.artemisprojects.org/tianxiaogu/mini-tracing)
    * A light-weight tracing tool built on top of the HotSpot JVM in OpenJDK 7.
    * Currently only support tracing events like method entry/exit, object allocation, object moving by GC (for identifying objects in the log).
* [MiniTracingForAndroidART](http://lab.artemisprojects.org/tianxiaogu/mini-tracing-for-art)
    * This project extends the built-in trace mechanism of Android ART by supporting logging Field Read/Written events.
    * Obviously, it is an experimantal extension and I only add 170 lines of code.
* [myblog](http://lab.artemisprojects.org/tianxiaogu/myblog)
    * A quite simple blog system built on top of `flask`, `SQLAlchemy`, `bootstrap`, `font-awesome` and many open source plugins.
    * It is simple as I almost do no customization on the style.
    * It can be deployed on Sina App Engine, a cheap PaaS cloud in China.
* [web-crawler](http://lab.artemisprojects.org/tianxiaogu/web-crawler)
    * A simple crawler based on selenium
